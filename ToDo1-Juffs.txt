This is the 'To Do' from Alan Juffs

I apologize for the delay, but based on class and GITHUB confusion, I wasn't sure what was due when, and where. I will try and keep up.


I looked at two corpora that would be useful to me in the ELI database.

1. http://talkbank.org/browser/index.php?url=SLABank/English/Vercellotti/
http://talkbank.org/access/SLABank/
All of these are in CLAN .cha format have sound files associated with them. They are also sound files, but you need CLAN to read them.
One could do a replication study of Vercellotti's paper here or alternatively look at other issues in these spoken data.

The data are not 'under license' but freely available.

2. For the second one, I looked at the one that you suggested.

And then I went to C-Span Inaugural Address Corpus [ download | source ]
id: inaugural; size: 321354; author: ; copyright: public domain; license: public domain;

These are .txt files of all the inaugural addresses of US Presidents.

They are plain text and seem to be available for all kinds of linguistic analysis based on lexicon and syntax, but not phonology.
